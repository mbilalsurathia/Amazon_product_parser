# Amazon_product_parser

This script is designed to extract product data from Amazon using a list of ASINs (Amazon Standard Identification Numbers). It processes each ASIN by constructing a URL for the corresponding product page, parsing the page to extract relevant information, and then saving the extracted data to a JSON file.




Dependencies: This script assumes that the AmzonParser function is defined elsewhere in the code. This function is responsible for fetching and parsing the product data from the provided URL.
Rate Limiting: The sleep(5) call is a simple way to implement rate limiting. Depending on the volume of requests and the site's policies, this may need to be adjusted.
